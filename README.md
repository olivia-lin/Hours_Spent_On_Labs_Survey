## Research Question

In an accelerated program, such as the Master of Data Science (MDS), students are often limited on time. As MDS students, we are highly interested in investigating whether attending office hours helped MDS students complete their lab assignments in a shorter amount of time.

Therefore, the main question addressed by our study is:

How does the number of times a Master of Data Science (MDS) student goes to office hours affect the average number of hours they spend working on labs per week?

This survey can be found [here](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6JSd6n3qKwaU4yp).

## Future Directions
If we could conduct our study further in the future, we would try to increase the number of respondents. It would be more informative if we could include previous MDS cohorts. Also, as we are focusing on the relationship between "attending office hours" and "time spent on labs(assignments)", while our confounding variables are highly academic related, we could extend our surveys to post graduate students in related programs.

For self-evaluated questions, we could utilize some courses or certificate exams that all respondents would have experienced, such as "do you find DSCI 512 to be difficult" rather than "rate your programming skills". It should bring the responses to be on the same scale.
